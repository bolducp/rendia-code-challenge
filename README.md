# Rendia_Code_Challenge
This is a client side app that renders a video, then an image, and then another video, created as a code test for Rendia.

Available live here: https://bolducp.github.io/rendia-code-challenge

### Code test instructions:
> Create a page coded purely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that plays a video, then displays an image for 10 seconds, and then plays another video. 
> The transitions between video and image should animate/transition smoothly and not require a page reload. 
> The videos and images should be within the same container. HTML5 is required.


## Instructions for running and developing locally

### To run the app locally, follow these steps:
* `git clone` the directory locally
* `cd` into the "rendia-code-challenge" folder
* if you have Python installed, you can use [Python Simple Server](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html), by typing the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` in the command line and then navigating to "http://localhost:8000/" in the browser
* alternatively, you can download and use the npm package [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve), to use Node to create a simple http server, by typing `serve` into the command line and navigating to "http://localhost:3000/" in the browser

### For developing locally:
* make sure that your browser is not caching files (you can check this setting in dev tools)
* now, as you make and save changes locally, you'll see them when you refresh the browser
